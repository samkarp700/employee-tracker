# employee-tracker
## Description
In this SQL application, an employer can review all available departments, roles and active employees. When an employer wishes to add a department, role, or employee, they can select the option and go through a series of prompts to add their needed department, role, or employee. Once added, they can select the option to view that part of the application and will find their changes and additions. 
Lastly, an employer can choose to update an employee's role by selecting the option, the employee, and then the new role. Once selected, they can review all employees to see the changes made.
